As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\n“Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.”\n\n#MarkTwainPrize #AdamSandler #kennedycenter #cnn \n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb",

        "title": "Benavidez vs Plant HIGHLIGHTS: March 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV",
        "description": "Undefeated two-time super middleweight world champion David “The Mexican Monster” Benavidez retained his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title with a bruising unanimous decision victory over former world champion Caleb Plant in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions. The judges’ final tallies were 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113.\n \nThe highly anticipated showdown between super middleweight rivals turned into the intriguing clash of styles that many predicted it would be, as Plant’s boxing acumen carried the early action until the brute force and high-volume power punching of Benavidez took over. After 12 grueling rounds in front of a sold out arena, the two fighters squashed their years long beef, embracing and expressing their mutual respect.\n\n“I know there was a lot said between us but in the end we settled this like men,” said Benavidez. “I’m happy we gave the fans the best rivalry of the year or the last five years. I’m just very happy.”\n \n“It’s a big rivalry but that’s what boxing is all about,” said Plant. “We came here and settled it like men. I take nothing from David. We haven’t been the best of friends but we got into the ring and we settled it like men. That’s what you’re supposed to do. He’s a helluva fighter.”\n \nAccording to CompuBox, Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) held a large advantage in power punches landed (180-68) but also out-landed Plant in jabs (30-23). Plant (22-2, 13 KOs) was the busier fighter, throwing 624 to Benavidez’s 551, but was unable to deter the late round onslaught from Benavidez.\n \n“I knew I had to take it step by step and round by round,” said Benavidez. “Caleb is a tough fighter. He’s not going to give you everything in the first few rounds so you have to find him. But I feel like I didn’t just show that I was a power puncher tonight. I showed that I had defense and head movement and I was able to move around the ring and cut the ring off really good.”\n \nPlant’s movement appeared to give Benavidez trouble throughout the early action, as Plant consistently landed two to three punch combinations and escape Benavidez’s counters. It wasn’t until round eight that Plant’s movement began to slow down and his attempts at holding were increasingly thwarted.\n \n“I was trying to hold him when necessary, punch him when necessary, and throw my combinations when necessary,” said Plant. “But when the best get in there with the best, you roll the dice and someone is going to come out with their hand raised and someone will come up short. And one thing that I pride myself on is that I roll with the best in the world. I haven’t ducked anyone and maybe we can have a rematch in the future.”\n \nAs the fight moved into the championship rounds, Benavidez pushed forward more aggressively, busting Plant’s nose and peppering him with short hooks from all angles. Plant stayed on his feet for the final bell, but his final attempts to turn the tide were thwarted by Benavidez. Asked post fight about his future plans, Benavidez set his sights squarely on undisputed 168-pound champion Canelo Alvarez.\n \n“I just want to tell everyone that I have a lot of respect for Canelo Alvarez but he has to give me that shot now,” said Benavidez. “That’s what everyone wants to see. Let’s make it happen.\nNow the fans are calling for this fight, the legends are calling for this fight, so let’s make it happen.”\n\n#DavidBenavidez #CalebPlant #BenavidezPlant\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

          "title": "Benavidez vs Plant HIGHLIGHTS: March 25, 2023 | PBC on Showtime PPV",
          "description": "Undefeated two-time super middleweight world champion David “The Mexican Monster” Benavidez retained his Interim WBC Super Middleweight Title with a bruising unanimous decision victory over former world champion Caleb Plant in the SHOWTIME PPV main event Saturday night from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in an event presented by Premier Boxing Champions. The judges’ final tallies were 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113.\n \nThe highly anticipated showdown between super middleweight rivals turned into the intriguing clash of styles that many predicted it would be, as Plant’s boxing acumen carried the early action until the brute force and high-volume power punching of Benavidez took over. After 12 grueling rounds in front of a sold out arena, the two fighters squashed their years long beef, embracing and expressing their mutual respect.\n\n“I know there was a lot said between us but in the end we settled this like men,” said Benavidez. “I’m happy we gave the fans the best rivalry of the year or the last five years. I’m just very happy.”\n \n“It’s a big rivalry but that’s what boxing is all about,” said Plant. “We came here and settled it like men. I take nothing from David. We haven’t been the best of friends but we got into the ring and we settled it like men. That’s what you’re supposed to do. He’s a helluva fighter.”\n \nAccording to CompuBox, Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) held a large advantage in power punches landed (180-68) but also out-landed Plant in jabs (30-23). Plant (22-2, 13 KOs) was the busier fighter, throwing 624 to Benavidez’s 551, but was unable to deter the late round onslaught from Benavidez.\n \n“I knew I had to take it step by step and round by round,” said Benavidez. “Caleb is a tough fighter. He’s not going to give you everything in the first few rounds so you have to find him. But I feel like I didn’t just show that I was a power puncher tonight. I showed that I had defense and head movement and I was able to move around the ring and cut the ring off really good.”\n \nPlant’s movement appeared to give Benavidez trouble throughout the early action, as Plant consistently landed two to three punch combinations and escape Benavidez’s counters. It wasn’t until round eight that Plant’s movement began to slow down and his attempts at holding were increasingly thwarted.\n \n“I was trying to hold him when necessary, punch him when necessary, and throw my combinations when necessary,” said Plant. “But when the best get in there with the best, you roll the dice and someone is going to come out with their hand raised and someone will come up short. And one thing that I pride myself on is that I roll with the best in the world. I haven’t ducked anyone and maybe we can have a rematch in the future.”\n \nAs the fight moved into the championship rounds, Benavidez pushed forward more aggressively, busting Plant’s nose and peppering him with short hooks from all angles. Plant stayed on his feet for the final bell, but his final attempts to turn the tide were thwarted by Benavidez. Asked post fight about his future plans, Benavidez set his sights squarely on undisputed 168-pound champion Canelo Alvarez.\n \n“I just want to tell everyone that I have a lot of respect for Canelo Alvarez but he has to give me that shot now,” said Benavidez. “That’s what everyone wants to see. Let’s make it happen.\nNow the fans are calling for this fight, the legends are calling for this fight, so let’s make it happen.”\n\n#DavidBenavidez #CalebPlant #BenavidezPlant\n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \r\n\r\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\r\n\r\nFOLLOW US:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"

        "description": "And why that’s a big deal.\n\nSubscribe and turn on notifications 🔔  so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO \n\nFor the first time in six decades, China’s population is shrinking, and it’s predicted it could create a demographic crisis. That’s because China isn’t just shrinking, it’s also aging. And the majority of Chinese couples are not considering having more than one child. Because of this, China is predicted to lose nearly 50 percent of its population by 2100. \n\nChina’s population decline can be traced back to the restrictive family-planning policies launched in the 1970s and an impressive economic boom fueled by China’s huge labor force. \nChina’s modernization brought rapid urbanization, rising income levels, and better education to large parts of China. Combined, these policies and growth have given China one of the lowest birth rates in the world. \n\nToday, China is trying to reverse its population decline. Not just because an aging population is hard to sustain economically, but because China’s impressive economic growth, until now, has relied on its people. As China’s population challenges deepen over time, it might have to rethink how to grow its economy and care for its citizens. \n\nYou can explore China’s birth and death rate data via the United Nations Population portal, here:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/MORT/Deaths/156\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/FERT/Births/156\n\nAs well as the country’s total population and predictions here:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/156\n\nHere are some key facts about China’s declining population from Pew Research:\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/12/05/key-facts-about-chinas-declining-population/\n\nYou can read some surprising details about China’s family planning policies — for example,  the One-Child Policy was actually less impactful than the Later, Longer, Fewer campaign — here: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/martinwhyte/files/challenging_myths_published_version.pdf\n\nHere’s an overview of China’s economic development from the World Bank:\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview\n\nAnd a report on China’s income gap:\nhttps://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/china-income-gap-rural-urban\n\nFor an in-depth look at the cruelty and human cost of China’s One-Child policy, I recommend the documentary One Child Nation by Nanfu Wang:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/independentlens/documentaries/one-child-nation/\n\nYou can explore population pyramids from across the world on the US Census Bureau’s website:\nhttps://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?COUNTRY_YEAR=2023&COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2023\n \nFinally, our expert, Professor Wang Feng, believes China’s population growth can be framed in a positive light.

My schedule is Tuesday & Thursday @ 7pm, Saturday & Sunday @ 3pm - all times based in Ireland.\n\nEdited by Ashtaric, you can find her here: https://twitter.com/xashtaricx\nAnd here: https://www.twitch.tv/ashtaric\n\nTo join my Minecraft server, head to my Twitch channel and type !server for the login information. You must be subscribed on Twitch to join, and have a Discord account. This is so we can moderate and manage the server due to demand. The server is open 24/7 and has a survival world, as well as a museum of every past build we've done on the channel.\n\nNew Earth Build Rules:\n-No obnoxious floating text. No obnoxiously tall buildings.\n-Respect the coastline and borders. Islands, continents and countries should retain their shape.\n-Build the best you can. Low effort and unfinished constructions will be removed.\n-Your building cannot just be a flag.\n-No contemporary politics.\n-No depictions of war, recent mass tragedy, racism or discrimination or hate symbols of any kind.\n-Railways must be at ground level. Railways in the air are considered low effort and too tall. We recommend an underground metro instead.\n-No pixel art (outside of the space of this wall)\n\nSpecial thanks to Nitrous Networks for hosting our Minecraft server. See their site for quality server hosting across a variety of games: https://nitrous-networks.com/",

No obnoxiously tall buildings.\n-Respect the coastline and borders. Islands, continents and countries should retain their shape.\n-Build the best you can. Low effort and unfinished constructions will be removed.\n-Your building cannot just be a flag.\n-No contemporary politics.\n-No depictions of war, recent mass tragedy, racism or discrimination or hate symbols of any kind.\n-Railways must be at ground level. Railways in the air are considered low effort and too tall. We recommend an underground metro instead.\n-No pixel art (outside of the space of this wall)\n\nSpecial thanks to Nitrous Networks for hosting our Minecraft server.
